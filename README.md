# Nura
---

## Description

Nura is an autograd framework in Python that utilizes NumPy for efficient multi-dimensional array (tensor) computations. It supports automatic differentiation in both forward and reverse mode AD. Nura also provides a neural network (nn) interface, allowing users to build models using various deep learning modules similar to the PyTorch API.
